Introduction to Historical Data Collection Using Web Scraping

Overview

Historical data collection involves gathering past data to analyze trends, patterns, and insights over time. In the context of web scraping, it refers to the process of extracting and storing data from websites to build a historical record. This can be valuable for a wide range of applications, from financial analysis and market research to monitoring historical news and tracking social media trends.

Why Collect Historical Data?

1. Trend Analysis: Understanding how trends have evolved over time.
2. Comparative Studies: Comparing past and present data to measure changes.
3. Predictive Modeling: Building models to forecast future trends based on historical data.
4. Benchmarking: Establishing historical benchmarks for performance evaluation.

Code to collect historical data using web scraping:

# Function to fetch data from CERT-In
def fetch_cert_in_data():
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()
    else:
        return None

# Connect to SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('india_cyber_data.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Create table if not exists
cursor.execute('''
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS incidents (
        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
        incident_id TEXT,
        date TEXT,
        type TEXT,
        description TEXT,
        affected_entities TEXT,
        impact TEXT
    )
''')

# Fetch and insert data
data = fetch_cert_in_data()
if data:
    for item in data['incidents']:
        cursor.execute('''
            INSERT INTO incidents (incident_id, date, type, description, affected_entities, impact)
            VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
        ''', (
            item.get('incident_id'),
            item.get('date'),
            item.get('type'),
            item.get('description'),
            item.get('affected_entities'),
            item.get('impact')
        ))

    conn.commit()
    conn.close()
    print("Data successfully inserted into the database.")
else:
    print("Failed to retrieve data.")

I am fetching data from CERT which is an indian  group of information security experts responsible for the protection against, detection of and response to an organization's cybersecurity incidents

5. Challenges in Historical Data Collection
6. Dynamic Content: Websites often change their structure or content, making it difficult to scrape consistently over time.
7. Legal and Ethical Issues: Ensuring compliance with website terms of service and legal regulations.
8. Data Integrity: Handling missing or inconsistent data across different time periods.
9. Volume of Data: Managing large volumes of data and ensuring efficient storage and retrieval.
